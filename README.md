Using this program you can perform the following tasks:

1. Analyze the performance of a stock portfolio.
2. Compare the portfolio's performance with a benchmark.
3. Calculate performance metrics such as cumulative return, yearly return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and Value at Risk (VaR).
4. Visualize sector weights for the portfolio and benchmark.
5. Assess the impact of adding a potential new stock to the portfolio on the VaR.
6. Perform a factor analysis on the portfolio.
7. Normalize returns and transform them to a uniform distribution.

# RULES
For safe use, I have a few rules to use the code correctly.
1. The only code where you are allowed to change stuff is "User-Defined Variables"
2. Do not forget rule nr.1

- Within "User-Defined Variables", do not alter the variables (blue). 
- If you want to add/delete something, keep the same structure. The easiest option is to copy & paste existing code.
- I mark you the code where you can input stuff with small explanations. 

Note: If errors appear, try first to clear all outputs, restart, and run all. Then, ask Chat to explain & solve the error.
